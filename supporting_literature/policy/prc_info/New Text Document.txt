**Li Keqiang Chairs State Council Executive Meeting**  
**Approves Early Allocation of Additional Special Bonds for Local Governments to Stimulate Effective Investment**  
**Deploys Enhanced Financial Support for SMEs**  
**Calls for Increased Subsidies for Vulnerable Groups**

On March 31, 2020, Premier Li Keqiang chaired a State Council executive meeting. The meeting decided to approve the early allocation of additional special bonds for local governments to stimulate effective investment; to deploy enhanced financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and to increase subsidies for vulnerable groups.

The meeting noted that recently, following the guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, a series of policies have been introduced to ensure supply and support enterprises, effectively controlling the pandemic while vigorously promoting resumption of work and production. Currently, in the face of severe challenges to economic development from both domestic and international pandemic situations and changes in the global economic and trade environment, it is necessary to further strengthen fiscal and monetary policy adjustments. Multiple measures should be taken to expand domestic demand, support resumption of production, and protect employment, helping various enterprises, especially SMEs, foreign trade enterprises, and individual businesses, to overcome difficulties and ensure basic livelihoods.

The meeting emphasized the need to further increase the scale of special bonds for local governments and expand effective investment to address shortcomings. Based on the special bond quotas already allocated earlier this year, a certain scale of additional special bonds will be approved and issued promptly according to procedures. The principle of "funds follow projects" will be applied, with a focus on regions with many key projects, low risk levels, and significant effective investment impacts. This will accelerate the construction of major projects and key livelihood projects. Localities should expedite the issuance of these early allocated special bonds, aiming to complete issuance by the second quarter.

The meeting established further measures to enhance inclusive financial support for SMEs. Firstly, it will increase the re-loan and rediscount quota for small and medium banks by 1 trillion yuan, implement targeted reserve requirement ratio reductions for these banks, and guide them to use all funds obtained to provide loans at preferential rates to a wide range of SMEs, supporting credit expansion to agricultural, foreign trade, and severely impacted industries. Financial institutions will be encouraged to issue 300 billion yuan in microfinance bonds, all of which will be used for small and micro loans. Secondly, it will guide net financing of corporate credit bonds to increase by 1 trillion yuan compared to the previous year, expanding channels for low-cost financing for private and SMEs. Thirdly, it will encourage the development of supply chain financial products such as order financing, warehouse receipts, and accounts receivable financing, promoting 800 billion yuan in accounts receivable financing for SMEs throughout the year. Fourthly, it will improve loan risk-sharing mechanisms, encourage the development of commercial insurance products to enhance credit for SMEs, and reduce government-backed financing guarantee fees to lessen the comprehensive financing cost burden on SMEs.

The meeting emphasized the urgent need to strengthen protection for low-income and vulnerable groups. It decided that from March to June, the temporary price subsidy standard linked to social assistance and security standards will be doubled, and orphans, children without guardians, and eligible insured unemployed individuals will be included in the policy scope. The increased subsidy funds will be proportionally subsidized by the central government and drawn from the unemployment insurance fund. These policies will cover over 67 million people. Secondly, it will include individuals affected by the pandemic into policies for minimum living security, support for the extremely poor, and temporary assistance, as well as employment aid. Unemployment insurance payments for urban unemployed individuals and temporary living allowances for migrant workers will be ensured. Research on policies to raise and expand unemployment benefits will be expedited.

To promote automobile consumption, the meeting decided to extend the new energy vehicle purchase subsidies and exemption from vehicle purchase tax policies for two more years. The central government will use a reward-based subsidy approach to support the elimination of National III and lower emission standard diesel trucks in key regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. From May 1 to the end of 2023, a reduced VAT rate of 0.5% will be applied to the sales of old cars by used car dealerships.

The meeting also discussed other matters.
