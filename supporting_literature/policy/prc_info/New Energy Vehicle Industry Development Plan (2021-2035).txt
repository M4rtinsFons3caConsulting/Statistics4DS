### **New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035)**

**Introduction**

Developing new energy vehicles (NEVs) is a crucial path for China to transition from a major automotive country to a strong automotive nation. It is also a strategic measure to address climate change and promote green development. Since the State Council issued the "Energy Conservation and New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2012-2020)" in 2012, China has adhered to a pure electric drive strategy. The development of the NEV industry has achieved significant progress, becoming one of the key forces in the global automotive industry's transformation. However, the development of China's NEVs faces challenges such as insufficient core technological innovation capabilities, an incomplete quality assurance system, lagging infrastructure construction, an incomplete industry ecosystem, and intensifying market competition. This plan is formulated to promote high-quality development of the NEV industry and accelerate the construction of a strong automotive nation.

### **Chapter 1: Development Trends**

**Section 1: New Energy Vehicles Inject New Momentum into Global Economic Development**

Currently, the global technology revolution and industrial transformation are thriving, with rapid integration of technologies related to automotive, energy, transportation, and information communications. Electrification, connectivity, and intelligence are becoming the development trends in the automotive industry. NEVs integrate new energy, new materials, and transformative technologies such as the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence, driving the automotive industry to evolve from a mere transportation tool to a mobile intelligent terminal, energy storage unit, and digital space. This transformation promotes the upgrading of energy, transportation, and information communication infrastructure, optimizes energy consumption structures, and enhances the intelligence of transportation systems and urban operations. It holds significant meaning for building a clean and beautiful world and constructing a community with a shared future for mankind. In recent years, major global automotive countries have strengthened strategic planning and policy support, and multinational automotive companies have increased research and development investments and improved industrial layouts. NEVs have become a major direction for the global automotive industry transformation and an important engine for sustaining global economic growth.

**Section 2: China’s NEVs Enter a New Stage of Accelerated Development**

The forms of automotive products, transportation modes, energy consumption structures, and social operation methods are undergoing profound changes, providing unprecedented development opportunities for the NEV industry. Through years of continuous efforts, China's NEV industry has significantly improved its technological level, gradually perfected its industrial system, and greatly enhanced its competitiveness. Since 2015, the production and sales volume and ownership of NEVs have ranked first in the world for five consecutive years. The industry has entered a new stage of overlapping convergence and integrated development. We must seize strategic opportunities, consolidate good momentum, fully utilize advantages in infrastructure and information communications, continuously enhance the industry's core competitiveness, and promote high-quality and sustainable development of the NEV industry.

**Section 3: Integration and Openness as New Characteristics of NEV Development**

As automotive power sources, production and operation methods, and consumption modes undergo comprehensive changes, the NEV industry ecosystem is evolving from a "chain relationship" among component, whole vehicle research and development, production, and marketing service enterprises to a "networked ecosystem" involving multiple fields and stakeholders such as automotive, energy, transportation, and information communications. Mutual empowerment and collaborative development have become inherent needs for various market entities to grow and strengthen. Cross-industry, cross-field integration and innovation, as well as more open and inclusive international cooperation, have become the era characteristics of NEV industry development, greatly enhancing industrial development momentum, stimulating market vitality, and promoting a new pattern of industrial development characterized by mutual integration, coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
