    Year 2024
    Status Announced (Preliminary measures in place until final October 30th 2024)

## BODY ##
As part of the ex-officio anti-subsidy investigation launched in October 2023, the EU Commission pre-disclosed provisional countervailing duties it would impose on imports of battery electric vehicles from China should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution by 4 July 2024. 

The additional duties would supplement an existing 10% import duty, and were pre-disclosed for 3 sampled Chinese companies as follows:

    BYD: 17.4%
    Geely: 20%
    SAIC: 38.1% 


The new additional duties would apply for all battery electric vehicles imported from China, beyond the 3 sampled Chinese manufacturers. Any company producing in China which would not be part of the final sample may ask for an accelerated review of its particular situation after the implementation of definitive measures.
