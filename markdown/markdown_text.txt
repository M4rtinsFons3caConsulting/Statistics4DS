### INTRODUCTION

In the Global EV Outlook 2024 (EVO2024), published on April 23, 2024, the IEA projected that by the end of the year, one in every five cars sold globally would be electric. Worldwide sales of this powertrain class were expected to peak at 17 million units, reflecting an increase from 18% of all car sales in the previous year. While these figures suggest a world undergoing rapid yet consistent change, they risk oversimplifying the situation, as the agency also reported that more than half of all electric vehicles were manufactured in China, a market that accounted for 60% of all EV sales during the same period.

The same report also highlighted a critical point: "The pace at which electric car sales pick up in emerging and developing economies outside China will determine their global success." While in contrasting sentiment, the New York Times quoted the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, who observed, “The Chinese are winning market share, and the Germans are losing.”

By the last quarter of 2024, the European Union had imposed heavy tariffs on several Chinese automakers, a move aimed at addressing a growing competitive imbalance, “starting to hit the safe places that Western carmakers had,” with many European factories reportedly “making fewer cars than they were built to produce.” Anton Spisak of the Centre for European Reform claims that at the core of China's competitive advantage lies its lower battery production costs, a significant factor driving its dominance in the EV sector, further questioning if the EU's course of action was adequate to meet its stated goal of regaining competitiveness in the automotive industry within a five-year period.

This geopolitical and economic rivalry raises a pertinent question: if public perception exalts the triumph of EVs as inevitable, should it not be possible to explain a substantial portion of EV sales using simple macroeconomic and demographic indicators? Such a notion suggests that the EV’s rise might be more easily predictable than the complexities of global competition imply.

### RESEARCH QUESTION

To what extent can macroeconomic and demographic indicators predict the growth in Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across different countries, and how do these relationships vary when accounting for individual country characteristics (Fixed Effects) and unobserved country-specific heterogeneity (Random Effects)? Moreover, does the inclusion of global macroeconomic factors (e.g., global oil prices, lithium) affect the significance of country-specific factors (FE and RE), and does it suggest a general trend in EV adoption that transcends regional differences?
