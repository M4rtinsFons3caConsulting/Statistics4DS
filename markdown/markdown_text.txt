### GLOSSARY

EV - (Electric Vehicle)

### RESEARCH QUESTION

This paper aims to explain EV sales data through a two part model, that consists of a set of global variables, and another of country level variables.

### METHODOLOGY

We consider a fixed effects model, and attempt to reduce the FE to as close to zero as possible; implying that all of the available information on sales is captured by the global variables.

# Feature selection

Features were selected for modeling based on one of two criteria. First those that garnered academic support in the forecast/explanation of EV sales, or price phenomena were admitted into the initial model, as a baseline. 

Then secondly, combinations of select variables were subject to grid search under the condition of minimizing FE.
