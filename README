## What if, tariffs?
# A Synthetic Control Group approach to short-term impact assessment for policy evaluation - the case of EU tariff, on Chinese EV OEMs, impact on German EV vehicle sales 

## Overview

```

Statistics for Data Science is a first year, first semester course in the Masters for Data Science with specialization in Data Science, lectured at NovaIMS, this github hosts our teams project for that course - class of 2024.

Our aim is to analyze short-term demand trend shifts in EV in Germany, with respect to European Union tariffs dating July 1st, comparing the performance of a Multiple Linear Regression model (MLRM), vis. Synthetic Group Control (SGC). With this result, we wish to show tentative results that SGC can be a useful quantitative tool for decision makers in policy evaluation, that can provide insights even in low-information density environments.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **R** (version 4.0 or higher): [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio** (latest version recommended): [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M4rtinsFons3caConsulting/Statistics4DS.git
   cd Statistics4DS
   
   ```

2. **Install `renv`:**

   If you haven't already installed `renv`, you can do so by running the following command in your R console:

   ```r
   install.packages("renv")
   ```

3. **Activate the `renv` Environment:**

   Navigate to the project directory and activate the `renv` environment:

   ```r
   setwd("path/to/Statistics4DS")  # Replace with your local path
   renv::activate()
   ```

4. **Restore Packages:**

   Restore the packages specified in the `renv.lock` file to ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. Run:

   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```

   This will install the exact versions of the packages used in the project as specified in the lock file.

## Additional Information

For more details on how to use `renv`, refer to the official documentation: [renv documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
